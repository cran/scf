\usage{
\method{residuals}{scf_model_result}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class 'scf_model_result'.}

}
\value{
A numeric vector of residuals.
}
\description{
Extracts the residuals vector from the first underlying implicate model.

In multiply-imputed data, pooled residuals are typically not calculated.
This returns the residuals from the primary (first) implicate model,
which is suitable for simple diagnostics.
