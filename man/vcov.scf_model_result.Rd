\usage{
\method{vcov}{scf_model_result}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class 'scf_model_result'.}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
Returns the variance-covariance matrix from the internal pooling object if available,
or stops with an error if the model object doesn't retain the raw pooled variance.
}
\description{
Reconstructs the pooled variance-covariance matrix of the model coefficients.
}
\details{
NOTE: The pooled variance matrix is NOT stored directly, only the coefficients
and SEs. This method is typically skipped in favour of direct SE access or
custom pooling, but is included here to provide a complete S3 interface.
