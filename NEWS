# scf 1.0.5

* Correct error in standard error estimates for `scf_median()`, `scf_percentile()`, and `scf_mean()`
* Suppressed known `svyquantile()` replicate-weight warnings for cleaner output.
* Added S3 methods for `"scf_model_result"` (`coef`, `vcov`, `predict`, `AIC`, `residuals`, `formula`) and updated model output structure accordingly.
* Standardized temporary-directory handling and safe file cleanup across all examples.

# scf 1.0.4 

* First version successfully published to CRAN.

# scf 1.0.3

* Created new mock data object for CRAN compliance.  Required altered testing across package.

# scf 1.0.2

* Minor nonfunctional error corrections to ensure CRAN compliance

# scf 1.0.1

* Minor nonfunctional changes to conform to CRAN submission standards
* Fixed `scf_load()` to expunge non-functioning deprecated artifacts
* removed scf_extract_implicates() as it lost utility in `scf_load()` rebuild

# scf 1.0.0

* Initial release of the `scf` package.
* Implements functions for weighted, multiply-imputed SCF data analysis.
* Known benign warning: `"non-integer #successes in a binomial glm!"` during logistic regression (see [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12953045/warning-non-integer-successes-in-a-binomial-glm-survey-packages)).
